# Readme: _inbox

The inbox folder is sused for adding other stuff, that I want to pick and choose from.
I use it for `git clone {url}` but do not add the other repository as a submodule to my project, 
because that would couple it to closely.

> See the `read.me` file and the `setup.py` script in the root directory for details.
